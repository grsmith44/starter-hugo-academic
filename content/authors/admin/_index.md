My research is currently focused on the special holonomy manifolds arising in M-theory Minkowski flux compactifications from 11d to 4d.  I use the tools of Exceptional Generalised Geometry to study the internal seven dimensional manifold.  In general I am interested in the geometries of physics, high energy or otherwise.  In the summer of 2018 I completed a long project with Prof. Mihalis Dafermos on the Cauchy problem in General Relativity, in which I produced some "bridge the gap" lecture notes between a graduate General Relativity course and the theory of Partial Differential Equations.

I have an MMath from the University of Cambridge, graduating with a Distinction in 2019.  I was awarded the Vice Chancellor award for academic performance and promise, alongside earlier David Thouless and Community contribution awards
